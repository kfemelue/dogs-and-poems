# dogs-and-poems

This repo contains code for an JavaScript/ Node.js website that utilizes an Express server, and EJS view engine to present users with a random photo of a dog, and a random short poem about a dog every time they visit the website.
The project is also containerized with Docker

## The Purpose

The purpose of this project is simple. I love dogs, I love poetry, and I have a feeling others might too.
